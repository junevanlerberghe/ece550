## Overview
This project is a full processor designed in Verilog. It consists of 5 stages:
1. Simple ALU <br>
2. Full ALU <br>
3. Register File <br>
4. Simple Processor <br>
5. Full Processor

### PC1 and 2: Full ALU
These checkpoints are combined into one folder since they build on each other to make a full ALU. 
This ALU does the following operations: add, subtract, left_shift, right_shift.

### PC3: Register File
This register file consists of 32 registers, which are each 32-bits.
